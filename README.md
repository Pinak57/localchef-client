Users can browse meals, place orders, add favorites, and manage reviews.

Chefs can create, update, and manage their meals, and handle order requests.

Admins can manage users, requests, and view platform statistics.

This project ensures secure role‑based access with JWT authentication and provides a smooth dashboard experience for each role.
